# Party-Planner

AP-CS A Project to create a table seating planner for a conference. Every company will send a set amount of people to the conference and the goal is to create a seating arrangement for the amount of tables and seats available so that every person at a table is from a different company.

Process: Overall, I created two main object types called Attendee and Company to store the data from companies.txt and partyguests.txt. The Attendee object stores attributes such as name, companyID, companyName, tablePos, tableID and attendeeID as well as getter and setter methods for each attribute. In addition, the Company object stores attributes such as companyID, companyName and employees
